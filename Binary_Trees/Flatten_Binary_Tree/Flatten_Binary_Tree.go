Write a function that takes 1n a Binary Tree, flattens 1t, and returns its leftmost node.
A flattened Binary Tree 1s a structure that's nearly 1dent1cal to a Doubly Linked List (except that nodes have left and right pointers instead of prev and next pointers),
where nodes follow the original treeÂ·s left-to-right order.
Note that ,f the ,nput Binary Tree happens to be a valid Binary Search Tree, the nodes ,n the flattened tree will be sorted.
The flattening should be done 1n place, meaning that the original data structure should be mutated (no new structure should be created).
Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.


Sample Input
tree =     5
         /     \
         2       7
         /   \    /  \
        1     4  6    8
     /       / \
     0      3       9


     // This tree has been flattened:
    nodeOne= 5 // the leftmost node 1n the flattened tree
    nodeTwo= 2 // the second leftmost node 1n the flattened tree
    nodeThree= 3 // the third leftmost node 1n the flattened tree
Sample Output

true  // the flattened tree's node's values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9



Hints
Hint 1

You can solve this problem pretty easily by traversing the tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique, gathering all of the nodes in an array, and then iterating through them from left to right and connecting them accordingly. Can you solve this problem without storing an entire array of the tree's nodes?

Hint 2

Try to figure out what the relation between two adjacent nodes in the in-order-traversal order is, as far as positioning in the tree is concerned.

Hint 3

At any given node in the in-order-traversal order, the node immediately to its left is the rightmost node of its left subtree, and the node immediately the its right is the leftmost node of its right subtree.

Hint 4

Write a function that recursively gets the leftmost and rightmost nodes of a given node's left subtree and right subtree and that connects the left subtree's rightmost node to the given node and the right subtree's leftmost node to the given node.
